## Workshop: Code Coverage in JVM

Everyone knows the phrase "you cannot control what cannot be measured".
But what does it mean when we are talking about the measurement of code coverage?
Maybe we are talking about managing the development process?
Or maybe about automatic testing? Or maybe not about testing at all?

Evgeny will help you figure out what code coverage metrics are,
why they are needed, when, and how they can be measured.
Together we will look at examples of using one of the most popular tools for collecting code coverage information — JaCoCo.
You will learn about various principles of use —
from Java and Kotlin to exotic JVM languages,
from integration with IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse),
various build systems (Gradle, Maven, Ant),
continuous integration and quality control systems (Jenkins CI, SonarQube)
to JaCoCo APIs.
And also learn to avoid common mistakes.
